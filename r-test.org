* Section

Trying an example of a reproducible report in org-more


Note that it is not possible to use nice keybindings to send code chunks to an R session (or at least I havent worked it out)
The way to be interactive in an org document is to <C-c-'> an <C-RET> to run the code chunk

* Libraries for R

#+begin_src R :session
library(tidyverse)
library(ascii)
#+end_src

* Data

We can read and example dataset  in to R and print the first 5 lines using the folloing

#+begin_src R :session :exports both
dat <- read_csv(file = "~/cars.csv")
head(dat)
#+end_src


The data is read in to R, we can now summarise the data
